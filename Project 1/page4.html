            <p>In 1989, Portland’s coffee culture began when a little unknown coffee shop from Seattle called Starbucks opened its first Portland location in Pioneer Square. Back before it became the corporate beast that it is today, Starbucks focused less on Frappuccinos and more on handcrafted espresso drinks. By the mid-’90s, there was a Starbucks in almost every part of town. Now, with over 30 coffee roasters, Portland is known for having an established coffee culture. Although Seattle is the birthplace of Starbucks, Portland arguably has the most intimate coffee scene in the whole country. Each and every coffee shop has it’s own unique style and laid back baristas. You can go in and catch up with friends, work and study in an uninterrupted environment, or have a relaxed lunch with family, all over an inventive and ambitious cup of coffee. <br>

                <br>After all, “the dream of the ‘90s is alive in Portland.”
