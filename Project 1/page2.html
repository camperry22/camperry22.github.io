                        <p>If you’re looking for a little neighborhood shop with walls of art, retro vibes, and locally-sourced coffee and tea, look no further than Floyd’s Coffee Shop, located at 1412 SE Morrison St.</p>

                        <h3>Spella Caffe</h3>
                        <p>This warm and friendly coffee shop in NW Portland simply spells C-O-Z-Y. Spella is an Italian- inspired cafe with fresh-brewed, single-origin coffee, handcrafted tea, Italian sodas, and local pastries. But, beware of the morning crowd, because the majority of Portland is likely to be found standing in line for a hot cup of espresso.</p>

                        <p>The logo of this local coffee shop can be found as frequently on shirts around town as a certain popular athletic brand. And there’s a reason for that. The coffee at Barista is perfect, the atmosphere is hip, the service is fast, and the interior of each cafe is uniquely decorated. If you order a cappuccino or latte, expect some Insta-worthy foam art!</p>

                        <h3>Case Study Coffee</h3>
                        <p>At this funky coffee shop, you can expect the unexpected. Sea salt in your cappuccino; hazelnut puree in your Americano and chills in your morning cuppa joe. With three locations in Portland, you’ll have plenty of chances to get goosebumps.</p>

When night falls, this swanky cafe turns into a swanky cocktail bar, complete with its own record-spinning DJ.</p>

                        <p>For a little taste of down under, venture over to Alberta where you can find Proud Mary, the coffee shop chain from Melbourne, Australia. After opening their first US location in Portland, this little cafe has vibes from both cities and has gained quite a following. Also, make sure to try the vegemite toast while you’re there.</p>
